# Project Overview: Alpha Programming Language Implementation

## Title: Alpha Programming Language Implementation

## Description:

This project involves the creation of the Alpha programming language, designed specifically for educational purposes. It's being developed during the Spring semester of 2025 as part of the CS340 Compilers course at the Computer Science Department of the University of Crete.  The project is structured into four distinct phases, covering the core aspects of compiler construction:

1.  **Phase 1: Lexical Analysis:** Implementation of a lexical analyzer using `lex` (or Flex), responsible for tokenizing the source code.
2.  **Phase 2: Syntax and Semantic Analysis:** Development of a syntax analyzer using `bison`, along with semantic analysis to ensure the program's correctness.
3.  **Phase 3: Intermediate Code Generation:** Implementation of intermediate code generation from the validated syntax tree.
4.  **Phase 4: Final Code Generation:**  Implementation of the final code generation, creating executable code.

## Goals:

The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience in the creation and implementation of a programming language.  Students will gain practical understanding of:

*   The distinct phases involved in compiler construction.
*   The challenges and techniques associated with each phase.
*   The interplay between different compiler components.
*   The theoretical concepts covered in the CS340 Compilers course.

## Target Audience:

While the primary development is done by students, the *documentation's* target audience is broader:

*   **Developers:**  Specifically, students and instructors involved in the CS340 Compilers course, as well as anyone interested in learning about compiler construction and language design.
*   **Future Students:**  This documentation will serve as a reference for future students taking the CS340 Compilers course.
*   **Potential Contributors:**  Developers interested in contributing to the project's evolution or using the Alpha language as a base for their own projects.

## Project Status:

**Under Development:** This project is currently under active development as part of the CS340 Compilers course in Spring 2025.  The implementation is ongoing, and the language specification and compiler architecture may evolve.
